# Finger Snapper 🏰
Finger Snapper is a Medieval City Generator, to help GM's create a more diverse cities in their games in a finger snap. 

> Also, this is a pet project to help me become a better clojure developer.

## Inspiration 🤔
As a DM, I've always tried to create unique cities in my RPG Games. To do that, I use the resources bellow:
- [Dungeon World's Steadings](https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/gamemastering/the-world/)
- [Battle Brothers' Settlement Situations](https://battlebrothers.fandom.com/wiki/Settlement_Situations)
- [D20PFSRD Kingdom Building Events](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/kingdom-building/events/)

## Features 🗃️
My idea for Finger Snapper is to have 2 principal features:
- [ ] Generate Cities
- [ ] Generate Events/Situations that affects a city
